# Zod to Swagger Example
This repository demonstrates how to generate [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation from [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas using the [zod-to-openapi](https://github.com/asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi) library. It includes a simple Node.js/TypeScript setup that shows how to define Zod schemas, convert them to Swagger schemas, and serve the resulting API docs in an Express application along with your endpoints that validate using Zod.

The benefits of generating your api documentation from your Zod schema is that the documentation will always be up to date with your endpoints.
